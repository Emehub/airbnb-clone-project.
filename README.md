# AirBnB Clone Project.

## Project Description
This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform **AirBnB**. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I will:
- Learn to implement responsive UI/UX designs  
- Understand how to structure a complex web application  
- Practice working in a team with defined roles  
- Develop skills in component-based frontend architecture  
- Learn best practices for web application development  

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or similar framework)  
- Version Control: Git and GitHub  
- Design Tools: Figma for UI/UX design  

## Requirements

### Project Initialization
- Set up GitHub repository with proper documentation  
- Include comprehensive README with project overview  

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create intuitive booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency  
- Ensure fast loading times  
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness  

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering  
- Detailed property viewing  
- Secure checkout process  
- User authentication  

### Primary Pages

| Page                  | Description                                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing      | Grid display of available properties with filters                |
| Listing Detailed      | Complete property details with images and booking form           |
| Simple Checkout       | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation                     |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.
